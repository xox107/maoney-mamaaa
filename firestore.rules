/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MONEY MAMAA application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * access their own data, which is stored under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information. The {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income entries for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense entries for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Only authenticated users can access data.
 * - Data is segregated by user ID to ensure privacy.
 * - All writes are validated against user ownership.
